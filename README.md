This is where I keep all of my tampermonkey scripts.
Tampermonkey is a Chrome plugin that lets you inject custom JavaScript into any website you want.
This lets you modify the behavior and/or appearance of any website to your liking.
If you want to use any of my scripts you will need to install tampermonkey from here: 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

## 1) Click on the tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar and the Dasboard from the drop down
![tampermonkey icon](/howToPics/SelectTamperMonkeyDashboard.jpg?raw=true "tampermonkey icon") 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## 2) Click the plus sign to add a new script
![plus sign](/howToPics/clickOnPlus.jpg?raw=true "plus sign")  
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## 3) Delete ALL the default text in the new userscript file so that it is completely blank
![deleted text](/howToPics/deleteAllTextToMakeRoomForNewCode.jpg?raw=true "deleted text")  
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## 4) Copy the text from my script and paste it into the new userscript in the tampermonkey dashboard  
<br/>

## 5) Save by using File > Save or ctrl + s on a Windows and probably command + s for a mac
![copied in code file save](/howToPics/copiedInCodeFileSave.jpg?raw=true "copied in code file > save")
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Note: some scripts are setup to easily allow you to customize some of the results, I have included comments in code where this is intended to make it easy for you to find but you can edit any of the code at any time. Feel free to fork my repo and keep your own and/or submit pull requests with anything you add, fix, or modify.
